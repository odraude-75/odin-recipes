## Description
This project is a fundamental exercise in HTML. The goal is to demonstrate mastery of core web structure before moving on to visual design. 

In this project, I have built a basic recipe website consisting of a main index page with links to various recipe pages.

> **Note:** This website is intentionally unstyled. The primary focus is "building HTML chops" and understanding document structure. I will return to this project later to apply CSS and visual styling.

### Skills Demonstrated
* HTML Document Structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<body>`)
* Headings and Paragraphs
* Unordered and Ordered Lists
* Links and Anchor Tags
* Image implementation
